      <p id = "starter" class="section-title">Fellow AMSUN Members</p>
      <hr>
      <p>A person whose integrity is unquestionable; a person who you can depend on; a person that will voice the concerns of and represent each and every one of you regardless of their religion, faith, color, creed, or class; a person that will put in 110% is the type of person we need in serving as the AMSUN Chairperson.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My name is Ireri Victor, and I believe that I am that type of person. I am ready to step into that position and serve you as the AMSUN Chairman.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In various capacities, I have learned more about the issues and concerns that we face, and especially the commitment required to solve the issues. This year particularly, I have been able to engage with quite a number of you and be part of the dialogue on the issues facing us.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Commitment is what I will give to every component of the medical school fraternity. Fellow comrades, it is your ideas and concerns that help in moving the association forward. It was the brilliant ideas that were executed by those before us that see AMSUN where it is today. I want to leave such a positive legacy.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I‚Äôm not going to go into stating empty promises, but rather issues I believe should be addressed. For example, getting lecture notes has not been a smooth ride and I do realize that there are lecturers who do not like sharing their notes. Nevertheless, this is an issue of great concern and I intend to work to get it resolved.</p> 
      <br>
      <p>Concerns about the existing model of student mentorship, where the beneficiary is almost always the mentee, have frequently been cited. The issue of bureaucratic bottlenecks when looking for elective positions need to stop and so is the ‚Äúhoarding‚Äù of opportunities in Med School. I strongly believe that we are making headway in resolving some of these concerns. Nonetheless, there is still more to accomplish; and I intend to see that it will be.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The single stone that can solve most of these problems is a working AMSUN website ‚Äì a one-stop platform where all things pertaining medical education and opportunities can be sourced.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My manifesto offers an in-depth explanation of how I plan to achieve this as well as solve the other aforementioned issues.</p>

            <p class="list-item-title">Build a working AMSUN website within the first 8 weeks of taking office.</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            <p>The website shall contain all the class notes from Year 1 to Year 6.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Besides being an academic resource center, the website shall have a blog where students can share their experiences through med school.</p>
            <br> 
            <p>The current model of mentorship where one student is attached to a senior one almost invariably benefits the mentee. By building a website where students can share their experiences, goes a long way in democratizing information.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Additionally, the website will be regularly updated with existing opportunities in med school and upcoming AMSUN activities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The website also provides an excellent platform on which students work, e.g., their artwork can be featured.</p>

          <p>
            <p>Having experienced the bureaucracies related to obtaining an elective position in the aforementioned hospitals, it is only prudent that we eliminate the red tapes by building strategic partnerships with the hospitals.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Doing so will ensure students apply for elective positions through the Dean‚Äôs office and are recommended to various positions without having to go through the bureaucratic processes.</p>
